## Disclaimer 🚧

The project was created to enhance my UI design skills. Please feel free to `star the repository` if you want to show your support and receive notifications about major updates in its development. Additionally, contributions are welcome. Since I completed it in a hurry, some aspects are yet to be finished, including state management, which I plan to add when I have some free time.
